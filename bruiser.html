        <h1>Fighter</h1>
        <p>At 3rd level, a fighter gains the Martial Archetype feature. Here is a homebrew option for that feature: the Bruiser.</p>
        <h2>Bruiser</h2>
        <p>You are a student of the school of rough knocks, a child of the street, or have been put in a scenario where the term "weapon" is ambiguous far too often.</p>
        <p>Bruisers use their raw strength and creativity in combat to devestating effect, keeping enemies where they want them and breaking weapons over the heads of anyone who would oppose them.</p>
        <p>They may be a bouncer for a rowdy tavern or an urchin trying to make it on the rough streets, but all bruisers excel at using their surroundings to their advantage and controlling the flow of a fight.</p>
        
        <h3>Improvise. Adapt. Overcome.</h3>
        <p>Starting at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with all improvised weapons. Your attacks with improvised weapons deal 1d6 damage if wielded with one hand, or 1d8 damage if wielded with two hands. At 10th level and 15th level, the damage of your improvised weapons increases as shown on the table below.</p>
        <p>The damage type of your improvised weapons is determined by the Dungeon Master based on the item being used as a weapon.</p>
        <table id="bruiserDie">
            <caption>Improvised Weapon Damage</caption>
            <thead><tr>
                <td>Level</td><td>1-Handed</td><td>2-Handed</td>
            </tr></thead>
            <tbody><tr>

            </tr>

            </tr></tbody>
        </table>
        
        <p><strong>Improvised Weapon Break.</strong> Whenever you hit with an improvised weapon attack you may choose to break the improvised weapon and deal an additional die of damage of the weapon's type. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Strength modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses of this feature on a short or long rest.</p>
        <p>Starting at 10th level, you may add one additional die of damage upon breaking your weapon.</p>

        <div class="columnbreak"></div>

        <h3>Street Smarts</h3>
        <p>Also at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Sleight of Hand, Perception, or Intimidation. You also gain proficiency in one gaming set of your choice. This gaming set counts as an improvised weapon for all of your Bruiser features.</p>

        <h3>Sweet Spot</h3>
        <p>By 7th level, you've developed an uncanny skill to pick the perfect weapon for the situation and the perfect spot to deliver it. Your improvised weapon attacks count as magical for the sake of overcoming resistances.</p>

        <h3>I Hold 'em, You Hit 'em</h3>
        <p>Also beginning at 7th level, you learn to partake in one of the most ancient, sacred, and universal maneuvers of the martial arts. You may add double your proficiency bonus to athletics checks made to begin or maintain a grapple or to shove a creature.</p>

        <h3>Where Do You Think You're Going?</h3>
        <p>At 10th level, you have mastered the art of keeping people and creatures precisely where you want them to be. You gain the following benefits: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>When grappling or restraining a creature, you gain the benefits of half cover.</li>
            <li>Upon successfully grappling or maintaining a grapple with a creature, you may choose to restrain it instead. While you are restraining a creature in this way, you have disadvantage on all attack rolls.</li>
            <li>You may make a shove or grapple as an attack of opportunity.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="page">
        <h3>Rough Break</h3>
        <p>At 15th level, you've learned how to maximize the effects of breaking your improvised weapons. When you use your Improvised Weapon Break feature, you may choose to add one of the following effects. If the effect requires a saving throw, the DC is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier.
            <br><b>Splintering.</b> The target must succeed on a constitution saving throw or be blinded until the start of your next turn.
            <br><b>Flooring.</b> The target must succeed on a strength saving throw or fall prone.
            <br><b>Intimidating.</b> The target must make a wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you until the start of your next turn.
            <br><b>Brutalizing.</b> You may add an additional die of damage to your break damage roll.
        </p>

        <h3>You Work For Me Now</h3>
        <p>Beginning at 18th level, while restraining a creature your size or smaller in a grapple, you may treat them as a 2-handed improvised weapon.</p>
        <p>When you hit a creature with this improvised weapon, both the target of the attack and the restrained creature take the damage.</p>
        <p>You may not choose to break this improvised weapon. However, upon your weapon hitting 0 hit points, you gain the effects of a weapon break but do not count it towards your weapon break limit.</p>
        <p>Whenever you make an attack wielding a creature as a weapon, the restrained creature may attempt to break free with an athletics or acrobatics check opposed by your athletics. </p>
