            <h1>Welcome to the Archives!</h1>
            <p>Inside, you will find all manner of mysterious new powers for those willing to take the plunge. Whether it be sheer elemental force imbuing your veins, the call of a thousand insects beckoning you closer, or the desire to hit the bard with a chair, you will find what you seek here.</p>
            <p>The question is... are you ready to pay the price for power?</p>
            <h2>Subclasses</h2>
            <p>This section of the archive is a bit barren at the moment, but I assure you after I find Dewey to get it reorganized, we'll be able to find more of the content we are looking for.</p>
